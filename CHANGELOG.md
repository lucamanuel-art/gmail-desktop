# Changelog

All notable changes to Gmail Desktop are documented here. This project adheres
to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.1.6] — 2026-07-07

### Fixed
- Per-account notification toggles in Settings now reflect the stored state and
  respond to clicks. Previously a toggle could show "on" while notifications for
  that account were actually muted, and toggling it had no effect (the settings
  UI was not kept in sync after a change).

### Added
- **Calendar reminders.** Google Calendar's own event reminders can now appear as
  desktop notifications, enabled per account (opt-in). They respect the global
  Do Not Disturb switch and quiet hours, and clicking a reminder opens that
  account's calendar. No calendar data is read — Google Calendar fires the
  reminders itself from a background view.
- Each account row in Settings now has separate **Mail** and **Calendar**
  notification toggles.

## [0.1.5] — 2026-07-06

### Added
- Launch at login (optional) and remembered window size/position.
- Per-account notifications with a global Do Not Disturb switch and quiet hours.
- Clicking a notification restores the window and switches to the right account.
- Drag to reorder accounts in the sidebar, and custom per-account labels.
- Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+1–9 to switch accounts, Ctrl+N to compose.
- Per-account zoom (Ctrl +/−/0), remembered across sessions.
- Light and dark theme for the app shell, following the system with a manual
  override.
- Google Calendar logo for the calendar button; removed the dark frame around
  the Gmail view.

## [0.1.1] – [0.1.4]

Initial Gmail Desktop wrapper: multi-account sidebar with avatars and unread
badges, per-account calendar, desktop notifications, tray with minimize-to-tray,
single-instance, account add/remove, and auto-update from GitHub Releases.
